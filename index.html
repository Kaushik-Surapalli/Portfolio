            Hello this is kaushik, I've completed my inter second year and was sitting idle in my house 
            So my friend called me and said he will teach me coding. 
            <br> <br>So, with all the excitment I started to learn it,
            <br> <br>but while learning
           <br> i felt it really boring,
           <br> but my friend made it very interesting.
